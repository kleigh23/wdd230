            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <h4>Game Stop</h4>

            <p>This page shows proximity because it shows the new video games that are popular and what is available, 
            and all the accessories like the PC parts and remotes are near others, and all hardware is near each other like the gaming consoles.
            This alows custamers to find exactly what they are looking for.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Target</h4>
            <a href="https://www.target.com/">target.com</a>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/img_target_new.jpg" alt="picture of targets website">
            </figure>    
            <p>This page shows Hick's law with all the options it gives like all the links and images of what you can pick. This makes you spend more time one one particular page.
                 This lets you see what options they have, so you will spend more money on their site. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="three">
            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>Bungie</h4>
            <a href="https://www.bungie.net/">bungie.net</a>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/img_bungie_new.jpg" alt="picture of bungies website">
            </figure>
            <p>This page shows Visual Hierarchy with how they show their new game extention that came out, 
                and then showing information about the current season and some of their events and goals they have as a company. 
                Obviously they want more attention on their new content, so that is front in center and much larger than the other options.
